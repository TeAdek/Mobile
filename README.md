- Its interface is appealing and convenient with visual display of the shows I added.
 
- It recently added a movie list into itâ€™s app without making a different app for movies which is convenient.  
 
    **The bad**

- It would be nice to category my shows or movies based on genres or any headings I wanted, instead of watching, have not started, up to date, finished, stopped.


2. **Difficult app-Prime Video**

    **Demerit**
- Even when you subscribe there is still ads.
- You can not select a different rotation for prime video.
 
- When you want to change the episode to a random episode, it is not added to the video settings, so you must go back to the beginning of the interface to do so. It only allows you to go to the immediate next episode.
 
    **Benefit**
- It gives you information and pics of the actors of each scene.
 
- It also provides a behind the scenes interview with trivia directly on the video interface.
The videos can be background play

1.	Context and text should be legible and readable
2.	Generally, core content should be available without internet or with low internet connection 
3.	Screen content and transition should load quickly.

4.	Focus on a smooth navigation and make it touch focused by designing the interface to be big enough for users to tap
